Tasks remaining before publication:
0) momentum calibration
1) Rate dependence
2) Ca48 contamination (need chemical analysis of oil)
3) check H(e,e’) and H(e,e’p) cross section
4) systematic uncertainties (rate and cut dependence)

Rate dependence:
Fe54: MF data taken at 25 uA, SRC at 50-60 uA.  Thinner target gives lower rates.  Expected effects on SRC/MF ratio ~ +2-4%
48Ca: MF data taken and 30 and 60 uA, SRC at 60 uA.  expect +2% effect on ratio
40Ca: MF data taken and 30 and 60 uA, SRC at 60 uA.  expect +5-6% effect on ratio
Need similar estimates for the lighter targets.

Studies:
Look at Ca40 and Ca48 MF runs.  Compare Hi (60 uA) and Lo (30 uA) current runs.
1) compare corrected yields 
 a) coin events
 b) prescaled electrons
2) compare EMiss shapes 
3) ratio of #proton tracks / # electron tracks for coin events
4) DC track efficiency

Do these for several different tracking conditions (cumulative)
1) original tracking
2) cut on stub delta x and delta y 
3) [Carlos to fill in #3,4]
4)
5) require golden track to hit hodoscope planes 3 and 4 and to have hit 6+ PMTs
