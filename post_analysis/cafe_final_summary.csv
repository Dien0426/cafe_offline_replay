# CaFe Final Summary File (Pass 1) 
# 
# Header Definitions: 
# target       : target name analyzed 
# kin          : kinematics analyzed  
# beam_time    : beam-on-target time [s] 
# avg_current  : average beam current [uA] 
# total_charge : cumulative charge (over all runs) 
# yield        : yield (counts integrated over Pm) with all data-analysis cuts applied 
# yield_corr   : counts corrected for inefficiencies (tracking + live_time) 
# yield_norm   : corrected yield (yield_corr) normalized by (total_charge, transpacency, area_density)
# tgt_area_density: target density (g/cm2)
# T, N, Z, A   : transparency (T), # of neutrons (N), protons(Z) and nucleons (A)
