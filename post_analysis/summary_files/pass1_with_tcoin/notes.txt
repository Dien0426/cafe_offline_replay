rate-dependent study on MF data analyzed
by setting  T2, T3 tdcTimeRaw time cuts on tcoin_fall22.param
to ensure the right tdc hit is selected for making a
coincidence.

This study was done under two conditons on beam current:

1) > 5 uA cut

2)  peak_current +/- 3 uA cut

The reason is that some runs have varying current, which
can be misleading when interpreting the effect of beam
current changes on the yield/mC
