rate-dependent study on MF data analyzed with a
beam current cut of:  peak_current +/- 3 uA

(some runs had varying beam current, and thus
an average beam current could be misleading if one
is studing yield dependence pn beam current and rate.
One needs to ensure a specific beam current range is chosen
to study the effect on the yield/mC
