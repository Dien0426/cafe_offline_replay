rate-dependent study on MF data analyzed
by setting  T2, T3 tdcTimeRaw time cuts on tcoin_fall22.param
to ensure the right tdc hit is selected for making a
coincidence.


directories:

./pass1_pruning : replayed data using pruning  (improved trackinh)
but without applying a T2, T3 tdctime cut in tcoin_fall22.param

./pass1_pruning_and_tcoinCut : replayed data using pruning and
also applying a T2, T3 time window cut to select the good
TDC hit before forming a coincidence (this is expected to
improved the agreement in relative yields betweem low/high currents)

There are two cases:

1) > 5 uA cut

2)  peak_current +/- 3 uA cut

The reason is that some runs have varying current, which
can be misleading when interpreting the effect of beam
current changes on the yield/mC
