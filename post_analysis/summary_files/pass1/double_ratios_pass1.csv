# Header Definitions: 
# target       : target A used in double ratio 
# doubleR      : double ratio of target A(SRC/MF) relative to C12 (SRC/MF) 
# doubleR_err  : uncertainty in double ratio 
# N: Z: A      : # of neutrons (N): protons(Z): nucleons (A): for target A 
# NoZ          : N/Z 
# NmZoA        : (N-Z)/A
