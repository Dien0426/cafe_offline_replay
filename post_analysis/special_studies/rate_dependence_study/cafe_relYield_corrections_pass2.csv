# CaFe Relative Yield Correction Factors (using MF kinematics) 
# 
# Header Definitions: 
# deltaY       : difference in relative charge-norm, eff.-corrected data yield between lowest and highest T2 rate runs 
# deltaY_err   : error in deltaY 
# deltaX       : difference between lowest and highest T2 rates [kHz] 
# slope        : deltaY/deltaX or drop in relative yield per kHz (to be used as correction factor) 
# slope_err    : error in slope
