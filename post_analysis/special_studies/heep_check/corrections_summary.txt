Used h(e,e'p) cafe run 16962 to determine step-by-step corrections applied.
After each step, a replay of both data/simc is done prior to next iteration
for the changes to take effect

sub-directory structure (step number)

initial/ (step1)
---------------------
-> no angle. / momentum corrections or offsets on either spec. arm
-> data has mispointing + beam_offsets applied automatically
-> simc only has beam_offsets applied

corrections determined
-> from proton momentum difference, Pdiff = Pcalc-Pmeas, a correction
factor of : hms_fcorr =  0.9977 was determined for HMS proton momentum,
Pf_corr = Pf_uncorr * hms_fcorr = 1.820 * 0.9977 = 1.816 
 
-> HMS Ytar also seems a bit off, might be due to mispointing not being
applied in SIMC ()

step 2
--------
-> applied HMS momentum correction Pf_corr to both data/simc
-> applied HMS mispointing to SIMC (to fix hms Ytar alignment)
