Used h(e,e'p) cafe run 16962 to determine step-by-step corrections applied.
After each step, a replay of both data/simc is done prior to next iteration
for the changes to take effect

sub-directory structure (step number)

initial/ (step1)
---------------------
-> no angle. / momentum corrections or offsets on either spec. arm
-> data has mispointing + beam_offsets applied automatically
-> simc only has beam_offsets applied

corrections determined
-> from proton momentum difference, Pdiff = Pcalc-Pmeas, a correction
factor of : hms_fcorr =  0.9977 was determined for HMS proton momentum,
Pf_corr = Pf_uncorr * hms_fcorr = 1.820 * 0.9977 = 1.816 
 
-> HMS Ytar also seems a bit off, might be due to mispointing not being


step 2
--------
-> applied HMS momentum correction to both data/simc (0.9977)
-> applied HMS mispointing to SIMC (to fix hms Ytar alignment)
-> applied SHMS out-of-plane central angle offset
(based on Pmy component offset)
p_oopcentral_offset = +0.002711 [rad]

step 3
--------
Found dEmiss ~31 MeV offset in Emiss and dE'=~30 MeV offset in SHMS e- momentum,
and given that final protom momentum correction was determined previously,
implied that the remaining shift in Emiss was entirely due to e- momentum,
NOT beam energy

In addition, the measured shift (from fit) in invariant mass was dW ~ 37 MeV,
From its derivative, dW= -Eb/E’*dE’, and also since we measured dE'~30 MeV,
the expected offset in dW ~ -10.549/8.55 * 30 ~ -37 MeV ! ! ! This is precisely
the observed offset in dW, which means the entire offset in dW was due to E', and not
Ebeam or e- scat angle

-> applied SHMS momentum correction to both data/simc (0.9968)
