Used h(e,e'p) cafe run 16962 to determine step-by-step corrections applied.
After each step, a replay of both data/simc is done prior to next iteration
for the changes to take effect

initial/ (step1)
---------------------
-> no angle. / momentum corrections or offsets on either spec. arm
-> data has mispointing + beam_offsets applied automatically
-> simc only has beam_offsets applied

corrections determined
-> from proton momentum difference, Pdiff = Pcalc-Pmeas, a correction
factor of : hms_fcorr =  0.9977 was determined for HMS proton momentum,
Pf_corr = Pf_uncorr * hms_fcorr = 1.820 * 0.9977 = 1.816 
 
-> HMS Ytar also seems a bit off, might be due to mispointing not being


step 2
--------
-> applied HMS momentum correction to both data/simc (0.9977)
-> applied HMS mispointing to SIMC (to fix hms Ytar alignment)
-> applied SHMS out-of-plane central angle offset
(based on Pmy component offset)
p_oopcentral_offset = +0.002711 [rad]

step 3
--------
Found dEmiss ~31 MeV offset in Emiss and dE'=~30 MeV offset in SHMS e- momentum,
and given that final protom momentum correction was determined previously,
implied that the remaining shift in Emiss was entirely due to e- momentum,
NOT beam energy

In addition, the measured shift (from fit) in invariant mass was dW ~ 37 MeV,
From its derivative, dW= -Eb/E’*dE’, and also since we measured dE'~30 MeV,
the expected offset in dW ~ -10.549/8.55 * 30 ~ -37 MeV ! ! ! This is precisely
the observed offset in dW, which means the entire offset in dW was due to E', and not
Ebeam or e- scat angle

-> applied SHMS momentum correction to both data/simc (0.9968)

after step3 corrections,
* data Emiss is still low by ~1 MeV, and W, Pmx, Pmz are not perfectly aligned (W ~ 3 MeV, Pmx ~ 3 MeV, Pmz ~ 1.4 MeV data off from simc)

* approach:

in the next step (step4)
--> lower e- momentum by ~1 MeV to align Emiss, (replay data and check, i.e., step4)

then the following step (step5)
--> find HMS(p)/SHMS(e-) angle offsets that best align W, Pmx, Pmz, this can be achieved via the following equations:

for h(e,e'p) since we know Pmiss x,y,z is zero, then we can write (by simple momentum conservation of e-p scattering)
Pmx = E'*sin(theta_e) - pf*sin(theta_p)         
Pmz = Eb - E'*cos(theta_e) - pf*cos(theta_p)  

taking the full derivatives (2 equations, 2 unkowns -> dtheta_e, dtheta_p):
dPmx = E'*cos(theta_e)*dtheta_e - pf*cos(theta_p)dtheta_p
dPmz = E'*sin(theta_e)*dtheta_e + pf*sin(theta_p)dtheta_p

where dPmx, dPmz --> (Pmx,z_data - Pmx,z_simc) ,   dtheta_e,p --> (theta_e,p_data - theta_e,p_simc)
the correction in angle would then be:  theta_e,p_corrected = theta_e,p_data - dtheta_e,p



step4
-------
Lowering SHMS (e-) momentum by 1 MeV had the following effects:
--> aligned Emiss and Pmz (Pmz is ~ 0.8 MeV off)
--> Pmx and W are still offset by ~ 4 MeV and 2 MeV respectively

** At this point, if we change e- angle to make W line up, the Pmx
will be offset even further, but if we change the proton angle, W
will be left the same, and Pmx will shift,

From the beam energy measurement, we know: 10.549355 +/- 0.0041371  GeV/c
so there is a dE ~ 4 MeV uncertainty in beam energy

*** Suggested next steps:  start the optimization procedure over but with
a higher beam



------------------------------------------------------------------------
START Re-optimization procedure by + 4 MeV on beam energy
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shift the beam energy by +4 MeV, and start procedure to determine if
we get better agreement between data/simc W, Pmx
(start with the determine out-of-plane offset as well as the HMS mispointings, as these will not affect this alignment)
