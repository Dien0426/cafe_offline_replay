CaFe Tracking Studies TO-DO LIST

diagnostics plots:

xptar, yptar, ytar, delta
# tracks (P.dc.ntrack)
Emiss for 1-track and all-track
Chi2
yield (did/should)  (i.e. reconstructed tracks over should have recon)


Short term - Carlos
0) establish baseline for both beam currents (Carlos)

1) reduce cluster size
(space point criterion,  pspace_point_criterion) - check #tracks (Carlos)

2) reduce track_criterion
(modify HCANA and do a hard cut to actually kill the tracks that don't meet the criteria) (Carlos)
(also put a cut to hodoscope number of pmts hit, pprune_pmt)

3) pruning - make sure track hits active part of scint plane in X2 (I think this is part of point 2)
( requires to modify hcana geometry for active areas (paddles >7) in shms hodo X1, X2 planes - Holly)

4) reduce drift time range in param file ( Dien / Carlos / Noah)

5) optimize pruning cuts ( Dien / Carlos /Noah )

more speculative (lower priority)
5) see effect of pmax_pr_hits
   plot this first
   reduce to 10,10 and see effect??

longer term - Dien
6) match DC track to scintillator hits in each plane
