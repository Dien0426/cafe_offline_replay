** remove HMS Hodo Track Monitoring  --> done

** remove ALL HMS Cherenkov-RELATED INFO  --> we do use HMS cher. for hadron tracking eff. definition of (basically, cer npe_sum < 0.5, suppress pions)

** add calorimeter info at the end, if we really want it, but optional
--> calorimeter beta is the most relevant,

** add expert level histograms at the end of onlineGUI (use "expert_" prefix)
--> add pedestals / PED MONITORING under the "expert_" category


** do we really need HMS/SHMS EPICS BPM in onlineGUI ?? Ask D. Gaskell. answer: not essential . --> done
** on HMS PID:  ONLY add beta from the track vs. delta, and calorimeter norm. track energy vs. delta --> done


** MOVE SHMS Hodo Track monitoring to "expert_" section

** SHMS/HMS Target Quantities: Remove Xtar, and put in ztar (HMS: H.react.z, 
SHMS: P.react.z, reaction vertex z-component)

** Remove ALL SHMS Aerogel/Heavy Gas Cherenkov Plots --> done

** Add Calorimeter normalized track energy in PID, as well as hodo beta as  --> done
a fucntion of delta: i.e., P.hod.beta:P.gtr.dp,  P.cal.etottracknorm:P.gtr.dp

* in SHMS Kinematics (remove W2) --> done
