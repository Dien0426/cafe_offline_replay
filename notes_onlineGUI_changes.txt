** remove HMS Hodo Track Monitoring 

** remove ALL HMS Cherenkov-RELATED INFO

** add calorimeter info at the end, if we really want it, but optional
--> calorimeter beta is the most relevant,

** add expert level histograms at the end of onlineGUI (use "expert_" prefix)
--> add pedestals / PED MONITORING under the "expert_" category


** do we really need HMS/SHMS EPICS BPM in onlineGUI ?? Ask D. Gaskell

** on HMS PID:  ONLY add beta from the track vs. delta, and calorimeter norm. track energy vs. delta


** MOVE SHMS Hodo Track monitoring to "expert_" section

** where does P.tr.beta come from?? --> Beta determined from hodoscope using track info
(maybe better to add P.hod.beta, instead) See THcHodoscope.cxx

** SHMS/HMS Target Quantities: Remove Xtar, and put in ztar (HMS: H.react.z, 
SHMS: P.react.z, reaction vertex z-component)

** Remove ALL SHMS Aerogel/Heavy Gas Cherenkov Plots

** Add Calorimeter normalized track energy in PID, as well as hodo beta as
a fucntion of delta: i.e., P.hod.beta:P.gtr.dp,  P.cal.etottracknorm:P.gtr.dp

* in SHMS Kinematics (remove W2)
