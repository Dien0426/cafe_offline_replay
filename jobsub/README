To submit a job to the batch, just do:

./run_bash_template.sh runlist.txt evt_number

Please refer to the code to verify job-submission
parameters are consistent with the user preferences.

and click on Swif2 Jobs under 'Cluster Info' which
will take the user to 'Active Workflows' section which
the user can look for the workflow name, and check the status
of the submitted jobs
