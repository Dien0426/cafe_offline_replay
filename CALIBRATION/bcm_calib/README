set_bcm_ranges.C : code to select zeros/non-zero bcm currents during bcm calibration
(select non-zero range first, followed by zero-range, and so on . . .)
the selection consist of an interactive plot, in which the user:

1) selects a range to zoom into first by clicking initial/final location of range.
initial location (1 -click),  final location (double-click), and it will zoom in

2) select the minimum/maximum range of the non-zero bcm current range, followed by the
zero current tange (consists 4 clicks total, with the final selection double-click to end 
selection process)

The selection process will print to screen the selected points which the used must put into
a file to be read in by the actual calibration code;

bcm_calib.C : code that reads in the selected points and does the fits of the data.
Output consists of fit results, called a "Gain" (slope parameter) and "offset" (y-intercept parameter)
for the selected BCM during the calibration which could be:( bcm1, bcm2, bcm4a bcm4b, bcm4c)
