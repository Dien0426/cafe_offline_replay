TASK LIST
-----------

* Dien will use the current skimmed files and have some of these plots by Wednesday meeting
* Carlos has to submit jobs to ifarm after adding histograms, and applying tighter missing energy cut
(so it might take a little longer than for Wednesday meeting)

For analysis checks:
(Carlos)
Data / SIMC comparisons for  H(e,e'p) 
Data / SIMC comparisons for  d(e,e'p)
Data / SIMC comparisons for  C(e,e'p)


Plot kinematics varaible (run-by-run) with all cuts and normalized by luminosity (Q*targ_thick) ):  xbj, Q2, Pm, Emiss  
* For each kin. variable [xbj, Q2, Pm, Emiss],
* overlay light nuclei (be9, b10, b11, c12) for MF, and SRC separately
* --> 2 plots (MF, SRC) / kin. var,  4 targets overlayed / plot

(Carlos will plot it run-by-run)
(Dien will plot it for combined runs using the skimmed files)


Single ratios (Dien):
(RATIOS of missing momentum distributuions, using combined runs)
MF_A / (Q * eff * tgt_thick) / [ MF_C12 / (Q * eff * tgt_thick) ]
SRC_A / (Q * eff * tgt_thick) / [ SRC_C12  / (Q * eff * tgt_thick) ] 


Double ratios (Carlos):
(integrated missing momentum normalized by charge using the .csv file)
(SRC_A / SRC_C12) / (MF_A / MF_C12) vs.  N/Z 



* SRC Weekly meeting:
1) show sequence of cuts slides
2) show missing energy vs. missing momentum for all nuclei (MF and SRC)
